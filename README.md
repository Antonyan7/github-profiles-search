Design or architecture decisions

- Uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- GitHub data fetched via GitHub REST API.
- API requests handled via **Axios** for cleaner and more maintainable HTTP calls.
- Global state managed with **Redux Toolkit** and custom middleware for handling async logic (e.g., GitHub search).
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library** are used for unit testing components and logic.
